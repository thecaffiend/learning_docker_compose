# Learning Docker Compose
Repo kept while fiddling with docker compose. I need a dev server, and I want
to learn docker/compose. Hilarity ensues.

## Get it running
* install docker and docker-compose as per [the docker instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* clone this repo to somewhere
* ... (more coming as I figure it out)
* profit!

## Dependencies
* Docker
* docker-compose
* tested on
 * Ubuntu 15.10
