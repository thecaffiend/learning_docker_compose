# Learning Docker Compose
Repo kept while fiddling with docker compose. I need a dev server, and I want
to learn docker/compose. Hilarity ensues.

## Get it running
* install docker and docker-compose as per [the docker instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
 * install the desired optional configurations:
  * [docker group (recommended)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#create-a-docker-group)
  * [run docker on startup](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntulinux/#configure-docker-to-start-on-boot)
  * [bash completion for docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/completion/)
* clone this repo to somewhere
* ... (more coming as I figure it out)
* profit!

## Dependencies
* Docker
* docker-compose
* tested on
 * Ubuntu 15.10
